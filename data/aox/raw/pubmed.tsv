3889590	Isolation of alcohol oxidase and two other methanol regulatable genes from the yeast Pichia pastoris.	The oxidation of methanol follows a well-defined pathway and is similar for several methylotrophic yeasts. The use of methanol as the sole carbon source for the growth of Pichia pastoris stimulates the expression of a family of genes. Three methanol-responsive genes have been isolated; cDNA copies have been made from mRNAs of these genes, and the protein products from in vitro translations have been examined. The identification of alcohol oxidase as one of the cloned, methanol-regulated genes has been made by enzymatic, immunological, and sequence analyses. Methanol-regulated expression of each of these three isolated genes can be demonstrated to occur at the level of transcription. Finally, DNA subfragments of two of the methanol-responsive genomic clones from P. pastoris have been isolated and tentatively identified as containing the control regions involved in methanol regulation.	1985	10.1128/mcb.5.5.1111-1121.1985	3889590
2582370	Molecular cloning and characterization of a gene coding for methanol oxidase in Hansenula polymorpha.	The structural gene and the regulatory DNA sequence of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha methanol oxidase have been isolated. According to the nucleotide sequence data obtained, the structural gene encodes a 664 amino acids long protein, contains no intervening sequences, and the 5'- and 3'-non-coding region contains several sequences implicated in transcription initiation and termination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the methanol oxidase is translocated to the peroxisomes, no cleavable signal sequence was found at the N-terminus of the protein.	1985	10.1093/nar/13.9.3063	2582370
2657390	Functional characterization of the two alcohol oxidase genes from the yeast Pichia pastoris.	In Pichia pastoris, alcohol oxidase (AOX) is the first enzyme in the methanol utilization pathway and is encoded by two genes, AOX1 and AOX2. The DNA and predicted amino acid sequences of the protein-coding portions of the genes are closely homologous, whereas flanking sequences share no homology. The functional roles of AOX1 and AOX2 in the metabolism of methanol were examined. Studies of strains with disrupted AOX genes revealed that AOX1 was the major source of methanol-oxidizing activity in methanol-grown P. pastoris. The results of two types of experiments each suggested that the difference in AOX activity contributed by the two genes was a consequence of sequences located 5' of the protein-coding portions of the genes. First, the coding portion of AOX2 was able to functionally substitute for that of AOX1 when placed under the control of AOX1 regulatory sequences. Second, when labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for the 5' nontranslated region of each gene were used, it was apparent that the steady-state level of AOX1 mRNA was much higher than that of AOX2. Except for the difference in the amount of mRNA present, the two genes appeared to be regulated in the same manner. A physiological reason for the existence of AOX2 was sought but was not apparent.	1989	10.1128/mcb.9.3.1316-1323.1989	2657390
2660463	Structural comparison of the Pichia pastoris alcohol oxidase genes.	In methylotrophic yeasts, alcohol oxidase is the first enzyme in the methanol-utilization pathway. The genome of one such yeast, Pichia pastoris, contains two alcohol oxidase genes, AOX1 and AOX2. Sequence analysis indicated that each gene encodes a similar protein of 663 amino acids. The protein-coding regions of the genes were 92% and 97% homologous at the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence levels, respectively. In contrast to homology observed within the protein-coding portions of the AOX genes, no homology was found in either the 5' or 3' non-coding regions. Although alcohol oxidase is found in peroxisomes of P. pastoris, the AOX amino acid sequences did not contain a peptide sequence similar to the peroxisomal transport sequence found at the C-terminus of some peroxisomally located proteins in higher eukaryotes.	1989	10.1002/yea.320050306	2660463
1770353	Modification of flavin adenine dinucleotide in alcohol oxidase of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha.	Alcohol oxidase, a major peroxisomal protein of methanol-utilizing yeasts, may possess two different forms of flavin adenine dinucleotide, classical FAD and so-called modified FAD (mFAD). Conversion of FAD into mFAD was observed both in purified preparations of the enzyme and in cells grown in batch and continuous culture. The relative amount of mFAD in the enzyme varied from 5 to 95%, depending on the growth or storage conditions. The presence of mFAD led to a slight decrease in Vmax and a significant (about one order) decrease in the Km of alcohol oxidase with respect to methanol. The kinetics of modification measured in purified preparations of the enzyme obeyed first-order kinetics (k = 0.78 h-1). The modification process was strongly inhibited by methanol, formaldehyde or hydroxylamine. Modification observed in continuous culture under steady state conditions depended on the dilution rate and could also be described as a spontaneous first-order reaction (kapp = 0.27 h-1). FAD modification could only be detected in alcohol oxidase and not in other yeast peroxisomal flavoenzymes, such as D-amino acid oxidase from Candida boidinii.	1991	10.1099/00221287-137-10-2381	1770353
1882546	Biosynthesis and assembly of alcohol oxidase, a peroxisomal matrix protein in methylotrophic yeasts: a review.	Alcohol oxidase (AO) catalyses the first step of methanol metabolism in yeasts. In vivo the enzyme is compartmentalized in special cell compartments, called peroxisomes. The enzyme along with the organelles are induced during growth of methylotrophic yeasts on methanol as the sole carbon source. Like all other peroxisomal matrix proteins, AO is encoded by a nuclear gene. Expression of the protein is regulated by a repression/derepression mechanism, but also by induction. Inactive monomeric precursor protein is synthesized in the cytosol and subsequently imported post-translationally into peroxisomes without further processing. Assembly into the active homo-octameric enzyme and binding of the prosthetic group flavin adenine dinucleotide occurs inside the organelle. When enhanced concentration of octameric alcohol oxidase are present in the organelles, the enzyme may form a crystalloid. Oligomerization is not dependent on translocation of AO precursors into their target organelle since octameric, active AO is detected in the cytosol and nucleus of peroxisome-deficient mutants of Hansenula polymorpha: at high expression rates large cytosolic AO crystalloids are formed, which occasionally are also encountered inside the nucleus of such mutants. This paper summarizes recent findings and views on the mechanisms involved in synthesis, import, assembly and crystallization of this important peroxisomal enzyme.	1991	10.1002/yea.320070302	1882546

1587486	Cloning and sequencing of the alcohol oxidase-encoding gene (AOD1) from the formaldehyde-producing asporogeneous methylotrophic yeast, Candida boidinii S2.	Alcohol oxidase (AOD) is the first key enzyme for methanol metabolism in methylotrophic yeasts. AOD activity is strictly regulated by carbon source. The AOD1 gene was cloned from a gene library of the asporogenous formaldehyde-producing methylotrophic yeast, Candida boidinii S2. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene and its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions (4174 bp) were determined. To identify the conserved and divergent sequences of the AOD1 gene and its 5'-flanking sequences among different species of methylotrophic yeasts, the AOD-encoding genes from C. boidinii S2 (AOD1), Hansenula polymorpha (MOX) and Pichia pastoris (AOX1 and AOX2) were compared. In addition to conserved amino acid sequences, several DNA segments in the G+C-rich region of 5'-flanking sequences were also found to be conserved. Northern analysis showed that the AOD1 gene transcript was induced by methanol, but was not detected when cells were grown on ethanol or glucose. Thus, as in ascosporogenous methylotrophic yeasts, AOD1 gene expression in C. boidinii appears to be controlled at the RNA level.	1992	10.1016/0378-1119(92)90708-w	1587486
8873445	Flavin adenine dinucleotide binding is the crucial step in alcohol oxidase assembly in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha.	We have studied the role of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) in the in vivo assembly of peroxisomal alcohol oxidase (AO) in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. In previous studies, using a riboflavin (Rf) autotrophic mutant, an unequivocal judgement could not be made, since Rf-limitation led to a partial block of AO import in this mutant. This resulted in the accumulation of AO precursors in the cytosol where they remained separated from the putative peroxisomal AO assembly factors. In order to circumvent the peroxisomal membrane barrier, we have now studied AO assembly in a peroxisome-deficient/Rf-autotrophic double mutant (delta per1.rif1) of H. polymorpha. By sucrose density centrifugation and native gel electrophoresis, three conformations of AO were detected in crude extracts of delta per1.rif1 cells grown under Rf-limitation, namely active octameric AO and two inactive, monomeric forms. One of the latter forms lacked FAD; this form was barely detectable in extracts wild-type and delta per1 cells, but had accumulated in the cytosol of rif1 cells. The second form of monomeric AO contained FAD; this form was also present in delta per1 cells but absent/very low in wild-type and rif1 cells. In vivo only these FAD-containing monomers associate into the active, octameric protein. We conclude that in H. polymorpha FAD binding to the AO monomer is mediated by a yet unknown peroxisomal factor and represents the crucial and essential step to enable AO oligomerization; the actual octamerization and the eventual crystallization in peroxisomes most probably occurs spontaneously.	1996	10.1002/(SICI)1097-0061(199608)12:10%3C917::AID-YEA984%3E3.0.CO;2-4	8873445
9396748	Peroxisomal targeting, import, and assembly of alcohol oxidase in Pichia pastoris.	Alcohol oxidase (AOX), the first enzyme in the yeast methanol utilization pathway is a homooctameric peroxisomal matrix protein. In peroxisome biogenesis-defective (pex) mutants of the yeast Pichia pastoris, AOX fails to assemble into active octamers and instead forms inactive cytoplasmic aggregates. The apparent inability of AOX to assemble in the cytoplasm contrasts with other peroxisomal proteins that are able to oligomerize before import. To further investigate the import of AOX, we first identified its peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS). We found that sequences essential for targeting AOX are primarily located within the four COOH-terminal amino acids of the protein leucine-alanine-arginine-phenylalanine COOH (LARF). To examine whether AOX can oligomerize before import, we coexpressed AOX without its PTS along with wild-type AOX and determined whether the mutant AOX could be coimported into peroxisomes. To identify the mutant form of AOX, the COOH-terminal LARF sequence of the protein was replaced with a hemagglutinin epitope tag (AOX-HA). Coexpression of AOX-HA with wild-type AOX (AOX-WT) did not result in an increase in the proportion of AOX-HA present in octameric active AOX, suggesting that newly synthesized AOX-HA cannot oligomerize with AOX-WT in the cytoplasm. Thus, AOX cannot initiate oligomerization in the cytoplasm, but must first be targeted to the organelle before assembly begins.	1998	10.1083/jcb.139.6.1419	9396748
10487924	Alcohol oxidase hybrid oligomers formed in vivo and in vitro.	Cell-free extract prepared from methanol-grown cells of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia methanolica showed nine multiple alcohol oxidase (AOD) bands on active staining in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their molecular basis was investigated and two AOD-encoding genes, MOD1 and MOD2, were cloned from P. methanolica genome. When the two genes were expressed in a heterologous host, an alcohol oxidase-depleted strain of Candida boidinii(aod1Delta strain), both MOD1 and MOD2 partially complemented growth defect of the host strain on methanol. While expression of either MOD1 or MOD2 in C. boidinii aod1Delta strain gave a single AOD band corresponding to the band with the largest and smallest mobility among the nine AOD bands, respectively, co-expression of MOD1 and MOD2 resulted in multiple band formation. Mixed oligomerization of Mod1p and Mod2p in vitro also gave nine multiple bands. From these results, we concluded that the nine multiple forms of AOD observed on native-PAGE represent two homo-octamers and seven hetero-octamers of Mod1p and Mod2p. Using this zymogram analysis, we also found that Mod1p was preferably produced at low methanol concentrations in the media, while Mod2p was produced at higher methanol concentrations. This shows distinct regulatory features of the two AOD-encoding genes in this methylotrophic yeast.	1999	10.1002/(SICI)1097-0061(19990915)15:12<1223::AID-YEA450>3.0.CO;2-X	10487924
11683419	Alcohol oxidase and dihydroxyacetone synthase, the abundant peroxisomal proteins of methylotrophic yeasts, assemble in different cellular compartments.	Alcohol oxidase (AO) and dihydroxyacetone synthase (DHAS) constitute the bulk of matrix proteins in methylotrophic yeasts, model organisms for the study of peroxisomal assembly. Both are homooligomers; AO is a flavin-containing octamer, whereas DHAS is a thiamine pyrophosphate-containing dimer. Experiments in recent years have demonstrated that assembly of peroxisomal oligomers can occur before import; indeed the absence of chaperones within the peroxisomal matrix calls into question the ability of this compartment to assemble proteins at all. We have taken a direct pulse-chase approach to monitor import and assembly of the two major proteins of peroxisomes in Candida boidinii. Oligomers of AO are not observed in the cytosol, consistent with the proteins inability to undergo piggyback import. Indeed, oligomerization of AO can be followed within the peroxisomal matrix, directly demonstrating the capacity of this compartment for protein assembly. By contrast, DHAS quickly dimerizes in the cytosol before import. Binding and import was slowed at 15 degrees C; the effect on AO was more dramatic. In conclusion, our data indicate that peroxisomes assemble AO in the matrix, while DHAS undergoes dimerization prior to import.	2001	10.1242/jcs.114.15.2863	11683419
15229592	Genome evolution in yeasts.	Identifying the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution by comparative genomics is often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. The hemiascomycete yeasts, with their compact genomes, similar lifestyle and distinct sexual and physiological properties, provide a unique opportunity to explore such mechanisms. We present here the complete, assembled genome sequences of four yeast species, selected to represent a broad evolutionary range within a single eukaryotic phylum, that after analysis proved to be molecularly as diverse as the entire phylum of chordates. A total of approximately 24,200 novel genes were identified, the translation products of which were classified together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins into about 4,700 families, forming the basis for interspecific comparisons. Analysis of chromosome maps and genome redundancies reveal that the different yeast lineages have evolved through a marked interplay between several distinct molecular mechanisms, including tandem gene repeat formation, segmental duplication, a massive genome duplication and extensive gene loss.	2004	10.1038/nature02579	15229592
16032762	Identification of four alcohol oxidases from methylotrophic yeasts.	Three yeast strains capable of utilizing methanol as sole carbon and energy source were isolated. Two were classified as Candida boidinii, while the third belonged in the genus Pichia. From these three strains, four alcohol oxidases genes were identified and the sequences of the coding regions were determined: one from each Candida boidinii (aox0673 and aox0680) and two from Pichia sp. 159 (aoxA and aoxB). Methanol induces both alcohol oxidases in Pichia sp. 159: the levels of aoxA and aoxB mRNA reach about 100% and 300%, respectively, of that of his4 mRNA. aoxA, but not aoxB, is expressed at a low level in the presence of glucose. The newly described alcohol oxidases have proper dinucleotide binding sites and PTS1-like C-terminal tripeptides, identified as important elements for peroxisomal localization.	2005	10.1002/yea.1236	16032762
17660304	Characteristics of Gloeophyllum trabeum alcohol oxidase, an extracellular source of H2O2 in brown rot decay of wood.	A novel alcohol oxidase (AOX) has been purified from mycelial pellets of the wood-degrading basidiomycete Gloeophyllum trabeum and characterized as a homooctameric nonglycosylated protein with native and subunit molecular masses of 628 and 72.4 kDa, containing noncovalently bonded flavin adenine dinucleotide. The isolated AOX cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1,953 bp translating into a polypeptide of 651 amino acids displaying 51 to 53% identity with other published fungal AOX amino acid sequences. The enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of short-chain primary aliphatic alcohols with a preference for methanol (K(m) = 2.3 mM, k(cat) = 15.6 s(-1)). Using polyclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence staining, AOX was localized on liquid culture hyphae and extracellular slime in sections from degraded wood and on cotton fibers. Transmission electron microscopy immunogold labeling localized the enzyme in the hyphal periplasmic space and wall and on extracellular tripartite membranes and slime, while there was no labeling of hyphal peroxisomes. AOX was further shown to be associated with membranous or slime structures secreted by hyphae in wood fiber lumina and within the secondary cell walls of degraded wood fibers. The differences in AOX targeting compared to the known yeast peroxisomal localization were traced to a unique C-terminal sequence of the G. trabeum oxidase, which is apparently responsible for the protein's different translocation. The extracellular distribution and the enzyme's abundance and preference for methanol, potentially available from the demethylation of lignin, all point to a possible role for AOX as a major source of H(2)O(2), a component of Fenton's reagent implicated in the generally accepted mechanisms for brown rot through the production of highly destructive hydroxyl radicals.	2007	10.1128/AEM.00977-07	17660304
17259976	Genome sequencing and analysis of the versatile cell factory Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88.	The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger is widely exploited by the fermentation industry for the production of enzymes and organic acids, particularly citric acid. We sequenced the 33.9-megabase genome of A. niger CBS 513.88, the ancestor of currently used enzyme production strains. A high level of synteny was observed with other aspergilli sequenced. Strong function predictions were made for 6,506 of the 14,165 open reading frames identified. A detailed description of the components of the protein secretion pathway was made and striking differences in the hydrolytic enzyme spectra of aspergilli were observed. A reconstructed metabolic network comprising 1,069 unique reactions illustrates the versatile metabolism of A. niger. Noteworthy is the large number of major facilitator superfamily transporters and fungal zinc binuclear cluster transcription factors, and the presence of putative gene clusters for fumonisin and ochratoxin A synthesis.	2007	10.1038/nbt1282	17259976
17476699	Distribution, diversity and regulation of alcohol oxidase isozymes, and phylogenetic relationships of methylotrophic yeasts.	In this study, we attempted to classify the methylotrophic yeasts based on diversities of alcohol oxidase (AOD), i.e. zymogram patterns and partial amino acid sequences. According to zymogram patterns for AOD, members of the methylotrophic yeasts separate into two major lineages, one group involving strains having a single AOD and the other group, including Pichia methanolica, Candida pignaliae and C. sonorensis, showing nine AOD isozymes. Based on partial amino acid sequences of AOD, the methylotrophic yeasts could be divided into five groups, and this classification agrees mostly with grouping based on 26S domain D1/D2 rDNA nucleotide sequences, except for some strains. Moreover, the strains having AOD isozymes constitute one group with P. trehalophila, P. glucozyma and Pichia sp. strain BZ159, although these strains are divided into two types, based on amino acid sequences of second AODs. On the other hand, these AOD isozymes consist of two subunits; the first subunits are induced not only by methanol but also by glycerol and pectin, although the second subunits are mainly induced by methanol. These data indicate that AOD isozymes and second AOD genes distribute widely in several methylotrophic yeasts in the natural environment, and second AOD genes may have evolved as methylotrophic genes that can adapt to the environmental conditions of higher methanol concentrations.	2007	10.1002/yea.1490	17476699
18685206	Cloning and expression of three formate oxidase genes from Debaryomyces vanrijiae MH201.	Debaryomyces vanrijiae MH201 produces formate oxidase (FOD) at estimated pI values by native isoelectric focusing of 5.1, 5.4, and 5.9. We cloned and expressed three formate oxidase cDNAs, FOD1, FOD2, and FDO3, of the yeast using Escherichia coli. The open reading frames of FOD1, FOD2, and FDO3 were 1,731 bp long, and encoded 576-amino acid polypeptides with molecular masses of 64,142, 63,794, and 63,836 Da respectively. Expression of FOD1, FOD2, and FOD3 resulted in the production of three isozymes, with pI values of 5.1, 5.9, and 5.9 respectively. Co-expression of FOD1 and FOD2 and of FOD1 and FOD3 resulted in the production of additional isozymes with pI values, of 5.4. The three amino acid sequences of FOD1, FOD2, and FOD3 contained a consensus motif of a flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site in their N-terminal parts and a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase signature pattern, suggesting that formate oxidase ought to be classified in the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family.	2008	10.1271/bbb.80121	18685206
19465926	Genome sequence of the recombinant protein production host Pichia pastoris.	The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is widely used for the production of proteins and as a model organism for studying peroxisomal biogenesis and methanol assimilation. P. pastoris strains capable of human-type N-glycosylation are now available, which increases the utility of this organism for biopharmaceutical production. Despite its biotechnological importance, relatively few genetic tools or engineered strains have been generated for P. pastoris. To facilitate progress in these areas, we present the 9.43 Mbp genomic sequence of the GS115 strain of P. pastoris. We also provide manually curated annotation for its 5,313 protein-coding genes.	2009	10.1038/nbt.1544	19465926
19525356	Comparative genomics of protoploid Saccharomycetaceae.	"Our knowledge of yeast genomes remains largely dominated by the extensive studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the consequences of its ancestral duplication, leaving the evolution of the entire class of hemiascomycetes only partly explored. We concentrate here on five species of Saccharomycetaceae, a large subdivision of hemiascomycetes, that we call ""protoploid"" because they diverged from the S. cerevisiae lineage prior to its genome duplication. We determined the complete genome sequences of three of these species: Kluyveromyces (Lachancea) thermotolerans and Saccharomyces (Lachancea) kluyveri (two members of the newly described Lachancea clade), and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. We included in our comparisons the previously available sequences of Kluyveromyces lactis and Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii. Despite their broad evolutionary range and significant individual variations in each lineage, the five protoploid Saccharomycetaceae share a core repertoire of approximately 3300 protein families and a high degree of conserved synteny. Synteny blocks were used to define gene orthology and to infer ancestors. Far from representing minimal genomes without redundancy, the five protoploid yeasts contain numerous copies of paralogous genes, either dispersed or in tandem arrays, that, altogether, constitute a third of each genome. Ancient, conserved paralogs as well as novel, lineage-specific paralogs were identified."	2009	10.1101/gr.091546.109 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000123 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020032 10.1186/1471-2148-6-99 10.1186/1471-2164-8-263 10.1186/gb-2006-7-3-r23 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000175 10.1101/gr.090605.108 10.1186/1471-2105-4-41 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030038	19525356
19465905	Evolution of pathogenicity and sexual reproduction in eight Candida genomes.	Candida species are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection worldwide. Here we report the genome sequences of six Candida species and compare these and related pathogens and non-pathogens. There are significant expansions of cell wall, secreted and transporter gene families in pathogenic species, suggesting adaptations associated with virulence. Large genomic tracts are homozygous in three diploid species, possibly resulting from recent recombination events. Surprisingly, key components of the mating and meiosis pathways are missing from several species. These include major differences at the mating-type loci (MTL); Lodderomyces elongisporus lacks MTL, and components of the a1/2 cell identity determinant were lost in other species, raising questions about how mating and cell types are controlled. Analysis of the CUG leucine-to-serine genetic-code change reveals that 99% of ancestral CUG codons were erased and new ones arose elsewhere. Lastly, we revise the Candida albicans gene catalogue, identifying many new genes.	2009	10.1038/nature08064	19465905
21575661	High-quality genome sequence of Pichia pastoris CBS7435.	The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) CBS7435 is the parental strain of commonly used P. pastoris recombinant protein production hosts making it well suited for improving the understanding of associated genomic features. Here, we present a 9.35 Mbp high-quality genome sequence of P. pastoris CBS7435 established by a combination of 454 and Illumina sequencing. An automatic annotation of the genome sequence yielded 5007 protein-coding genes, 124 tRNAs and 29 rRNAs. Moreover, we report the complete DNA sequence of the first mitochondrial genome of a methylotrophic yeast. Fifteen genes encoding proteins, 2 rRNA and 25 tRNA loci were identified on the 35.7 kbp circular, mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, the architecture of the putative alpha mating factor protein of P. pastoris CBS7435 turned out to be more complex than the corresponding protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2011	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.04.014	21575661
22123960	Evolutionary erosion of yeast sex chromosomes by mating-type switching accidents.	We investigate yeast sex chromosome evolution by comparing genome sequences from 16 species in the family Saccharomycetaceae, including data from genera Tetrapisispora, Kazachstania, Naumovozyma, and Torulaspora. We show that although most yeast species contain a mating-type (MAT) locus and silent HML and HMR loci structurally analogous to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, their detailed organization is highly variable and indicates that the MAT locus is a deletion hotspot. Over evolutionary time, chromosomal genes located immediately beside MAT have continually been deleted, truncated, or transposed to other places in the genome in a process that is gradually shortening the distance between MAT and HML. Each time a gene beside MAT is removed by deletion or transposition, the next gene on the chromosome is brought into proximity with MAT and is in turn put at risk for removal. This process has also continually replaced the triplicated sequence regions, called Z and X, that allow HML and HMR to be used as templates for DNA repair at MAT during mating-type switching. We propose that the deletion and transposition events are caused by evolutionary accidents during mating-type switching, combined with natural selection to keep MAT and HML on the same chromosome. The rate of deletion accelerated greatly after whole-genome duplication, probably because genes were redundant and could be deleted without requiring transposition. We suggest that, despite its mutational cost, switching confers an evolutionary benefit by providing a way for an isolated germinating spore to reform spores if the environment is too poor.	2011	10.1073/pnas.1112808108	22123960
23022488	A potential role for an extracellular methanol oxidase secreted by Moniliophthora perniciosa in Witches' broom disease in cacao.	The hemibiotrophic basidiomycete fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of Witches' broom disease (WBD) in cacao, is able to grow on methanol as the sole carbon source. In plants, one of the main sources of methanol is the pectin present in the structure of cell walls. Pectin is composed of highly methylesterified chains of galacturonic acid. The hydrolysis between the methyl radicals and galacturonic acid in esterified pectin, mediated by a pectin methylesterase (PME), releases methanol, which may be decomposed by a methanol oxidase (MOX). The analysis of the M. pernciosa genome revealed putative mox and pme genes. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR performed with RNA from mycelia grown in the presence of methanol or pectin as the sole carbon source and with RNA from infected cacao seedlings in different stages of the progression of WBD indicate that the two genes are coregulated, suggesting that the fungus may be metabolizing the methanol released from pectin. Moreover, immunolocalization of homogalacturonan, the main pectic domain that constitutes the primary cell wall matrix, shows a reduction in the level of pectin methyl esterification in infected cacao seedlings. Although MOX has been classically classified as a peroxisomal enzyme, M. perniciosa presents an extracellular methanol oxidase. Its activity was detected in the fungus culture supernatants, and mass spectrometry analysis indicated the presence of this enzyme in the fungus secretome. Because M. pernciosa possesses all genes classically related to methanol metabolism, we propose a peroxisome-independent model for the utilization of methanol by this fungus, which begins with the extracellular oxidation of methanol derived from the demethylation of pectin and finishes in the cytosol.	2012	10.1016/j.fgb.2012.09.001	23022488
23280342	Establishment and interpretation of the genome sequence of the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IB isolate 7/3/14.	Anastomosis group AG1-IB isolates of the anamorphic basidiomycetous fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kühn affect various agricultural and horticultural important crops including bean, rice, soybean, figs, hortensia, cabbage and lettuce. To gain insights into the genome structure and content, the first draft genome sequence of R. solani AG1-IB isolate 7/3/14 was established. Four complete runs on the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX platform (Roche Applied Science) yielding approx. a 25-fold coverage of the R. solani genome were accomplished. Assembly of the sequence reads by means of the gsAssembler software version 2.6 applying the heterozygotic mode resulted in numerous contigs and scaffolds and a predicted size of 87.1 Mb for the diploid status of the genome. 'Contig-length vs. read-count' analysis revealed that the assembled contigs can be classified into five different groups. Detailed BLAST-analysis revealed that most contigs of group II feature high-scoring matches to other contigs of the same group suggesting that distinguishable allelic variants exist for many genes. Due to the supposed diploid and heterokaryotic nature of R. solani AG1-IB 7/3/14, this result has been anticipated. However, the heterokaryotic character of the isolate is not really supported by sequencing data obtained for the isolate R. solani AG1-IB 7/3/14. Coverage of group III contigs is twice as high as for group II contigs which can also be explained by the diploid status of the genome and indistinguishable alleles on homologous chromosomes. Assembly of sequence data led to the identification of the rRNA unit (group V contigs) and the mitochondrial (mt) genome (group IV contigs) which is a circular molecule of 162,751 bp in size featuring a GC-content of 36.4%. The R. solani 7/3/14 mt-genome is one of the largest fungal mitochondrial genomes known to date. Its large size essentially is due to the presence of numerous non-conserved hypothetical ORFs and introns. Gene prediction for the R. solani AG1-IB 7/3/14 genome was conducted by the Augustus Gene Prediction Software for Eukaryotes (version 2.6.) applying the parameter set for the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea okayama 7#130. Gene prediction and annotation provided first insights into the R. solani AG1-IB 7/3/14 gene structure and content. In total, 12,422 genes were predicted. The average number of exons per gene is five. Exons have a mean length of 214 bp, whereas introns on average are 66 bp in length. Annotation of the genome revealed that 4169 of 12,422 genes could be assigned to KOG functional categories.	2013	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.12.010	23280342
24279325	Genome sequence and analysis of methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha DL1.	Hansenula polymorpha DL1 is a methylotrophic yeast, widely used in fundamental studies of methanol metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis and function, and also as a microbial cell factory for production of recombinant proteins and metabolic engineering towards the goal of high temperature ethanol production. We have sequenced the 9 Mbp H. polymorpha DL1 genome and performed whole-genome analysis for the H. polymorpha transcriptome obtained from both methanol- and glucose-grown cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed the complex and dynamic character of the H. polymorpha transcriptome under the two studied conditions, identified abundant and highly unregulated expression of 40% of the genome in methanol grown cells, and revealed alternative splicing events. We have identified subtelomerically biased protein families in H. polymorpha, clusters of LTR elements at G + C-poor chromosomal loci in the middle of each of the seven H. polymorpha chromosomes, and established the evolutionary position of H. polymorpha DL1 within a separate yeast clade together with the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and the non-methylotrophic yeast Dekkera bruxellensis. Intergenome comparisons uncovered extensive gene order reshuffling between the three yeast genomes. Phylogenetic analyses enabled us to reveal patterns of evolution of methylotrophy in yeasts and filamentous fungi. Our results open new opportunities for in-depth understanding of many aspects of H. polymorpha life cycle, physiology and metabolism as well as genome evolution in methylotrophic yeasts and may lead to novel improvements toward the application of H. polymorpha DL-1 as a microbial cell factory.	2013	10.1186/1471-2164-14-837	24279325
24671405	Methanol-inducible promoter of thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea thermomethanolica BCC16875 potential for production of heterologous protein at high temperatures.	Methanol-utilizing metabolism is generally found in methylotrophic yeasts. Several potential promoters regulating enzymes in this pathway have been extensively studied, especially alcohol oxidase. Here, we characterized the alcohol oxidase gene promoter from thermotolerant Ogataea thermomethanolica (OthAOX). This promoter can be induced by methanol, and was shown to regulate expression of phytase up to 45 °C. The pattern of heterologous phytase N-glycosylation depends on the induction temperature. Unlike the AOX promoter from Pichia pastoris, this OthAOX initially turns on the expression of the heterologous protein at the de-repression stage in the presence of glycerol. Full induction of protein is observed when methanol is present. With this methanol-inducible promoter, target protein can be initially produced prior to the induction phase, which would help shorten the time for protein production. Being able to drive protein expression at various temperatures prompts this newly identified AOX promoter to be potential tool for heterologous protein production in high temperature conditions.	2014	10.1007/s00284-014-0568-x	24671405

27535936	Comparative genomics of biotechnologically important yeasts.	Ascomycete yeasts are metabolically diverse, with great potential for biotechnology. Here, we report the comparative genome analysis of 29 taxonomically and biotechnologically important yeasts, including 16 newly sequenced. We identify a genetic code change, CUG-Ala, in Pachysolen tannophilus in the clade sister to the known CUG-Ser clade. Our well-resolved yeast phylogeny shows that some traits, such as methylotrophy, are restricted to single clades, whereas others, such as l-rhamnose utilization, have patchy phylogenetic distributions. Gene clusters, with variable organization and distribution, encode many pathways of interest. Genomics can predict some biochemical traits precisely, but the genomic basis of others, such as xylose utilization, remains unresolved. Our data also provide insight into early evolution of ascomycetes. We document the loss of H3K9me2/3 heterochromatin, the origin of ascomycete mating-type switching, and panascomycete synteny at the MAT locus. These data and analyses will facilitate the engineering of efficient biosynthetic and degradative pathways and gateways for genomic manipulation.	2016	10.1073/pnas.1603941113	27535936
27603307	Sequence Assembly of Yarrowia lipolytica Strain W29/CLIB89 Shows Transposable Element Diversity.	Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast, is capable of accumulating significant cellular mass in lipid making it an important source of biosustainable hydrocarbon-based chemicals. In spite of a similar number of protein-coding genes to that in other Hemiascomycetes, the Y. lipolytica genome is almost double that of model yeasts. Despite its economic importance and several distinct strains in common use, an independent genome assembly exists for only one strain. We report here a de novo annotated assembly of the chromosomal genome of an industrially-relevant strain, W29/CLIB89, determined by hybrid next-generation sequencing. For the first time, each Y. lipolytica chromosome is represented by a single contig. The telomeric rDNA repeats were localized by Irys long-range genome mapping and one complete copy of the rDNA sequence is reported. Two large structural variants and retroelement differences with reference strain CLIB122 including a full-length, novel Ty3/Gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon and multiple LTR-like sequences are described. Strikingly, several of these are adjacent to RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, which are almost double in number in Y. lipolytica compared to other Hemiascomycetes. In addition to previously-reported dimeric RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, tRNA pseudogenes were identified. Multiple full-length and truncated LINE elements are also present. Therefore, although identified transposons do not constitute a significant fraction of the Y. lipolytica genome, they could have played an active role in its evolution. Differences between the sequence of this strain and of the existing reference strain underscore the utility of an additional independent genome assembly for this economically important organism.	2016	10.1371/journal.pone.0162363 10.1016/j.ymben.2012.08.007 10.1002/yea.2921 10.1016/j.copbio.2015.08.010 10.1371/journal.pone.0123188 10.1038/npjsba.2016.5 10.1007/s10295-014-1539-8 10.1038/nature02579 10.1128/EC.4.3.615-624.2005 10.1101/gr.219202 10.1038/ncomms4131 10.1007/s00253-011-3212-8 10.1007/s00253-013-5295-x 10.1128/genomeA.00652-14 10.1128/genomeA.01211-15 10.1186/1471-2105-13-237 10.1186/1471-2105-15-229 10.1186/1471-2105-6-31 10.1101/gr.3672305 10.1002/yea.1214 10.1093/nar/gkn549 10.1093/nar/gkl085 10.1007/s00294-013-0389-7 10.1093/molbev/msg155 10.1146/annurev.micro.57.030502.091029 10.1128/microbiolspec.MDNA3-0057-2014 10.1002/yea.1287 10.1093/emboj/17.16.4873 10.1186/1471-2199-8-94 10.1038/nrmicro2655 10.1371/journal.pone.0079288 10.1128/microbiolspec.MDNA3-0053-2014 10.1128/microbiolspec.MDNA3-0061-2014 10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091549 10.1038/ng1223 10.1093/nar/gks1263 10.1038/hdy.2011.43 10.1101/gr.074492.107 10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm404 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120 10.1093/nar/gki937 10.1101/gr.081612.108 10.1093/nar/gki458 10.1093/nar/gku989 10.1105/tpc.15.00933 10.1111/j.1567-1364.2011.00782.x 10.1002/cfg.72 10.1186/gb-2004-5-2-r12	27603307
27388471	Curation of the genome annotation of Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) CBS7435 from gene level to protein function.	As manually curated and non-automated BLAST analysis of the published Pichia pastoris genome sequences revealed many differences between the gene annotations of the strains GS115 and CBS7435, RNA-Seq analysis, supported by proteomics, was performed to improve the genome annotation. Detailed analysis of sequence alignment and protein domain predictions were made to extend the functional genome annotation to all P. pastoris sequences. This allowed the identification of 492 new ORFs, 4916 hypothetical UTRs and the correction of 341 incorrect ORF predictions, which were mainly due to the presence of upstream ATG or erroneous intron predictions. Moreover, 175 previously erroneously annotated ORFs need to be removed from the annotation. In total, we have annotated 5325 ORFs. Regarding the functionality of those genes, we improved all gene and protein descriptions. Thereby, the percentage of ORFs with functional annotation was increased from 48% to 73%. Furthermore, we defined functional groups, covering 25 biological cellular processes of interest, by grouping all genes that are part of the defined process. All data are presented in the newly launched genome browser and database available at www.pichiagenome.org In summary, we present a wide spectrum of curation of the P. pastoris genome annotation from gene level to protein function.	2016	10.1093/femsyr/fow051	27388471

33906412	Shared evolutionary footprints suggest mitochondrial oxidative damage underlies multiple complex I losses in fungi.	Oxidative phosphorylation is among the most conserved mitochondrial pathways. However, one of the cornerstones of this pathway, the multi-protein complex NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) has been lost multiple independent times in diverse eukaryotic lineages. The causes and consequences of these convergent losses remain poorly understood. Here, we used a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct evolutionary paths leading to complex I loss and infer possible evolutionary scenarios. By mining available mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, we identified eight independent events of mitochondrial complex I loss across eukaryotes, of which six occurred in fungal lineages. We focused on three recent loss events that affect closely related fungal species, and inferred genomic changes convergently associated with complex I loss. Based on these results, we predict novel complex I functional partners and relate the loss of complex I with the presence of increased mitochondrial antioxidants, higher fermentative capabilities, duplications of alternative dehydrogenases, loss of alternative oxidases and adaptation to antifungal compounds. To explain these findings, we hypothesize that a combination of previously acquired compensatory mechanisms and exposure to environmental triggers of oxidative stress (such as hypoxia and/or toxic chemicals) induced complex I loss in fungi.	2021	10.1098/rsob.200362 10.1126/science.283.5407.1488 10.1016/j.bbabio.2016.01.013 10.1371/journal.pone.0158724 10.1016/j.drup.2019.02.002 10.1073/pnas.1711888115 10.1093/hmg/ddp069 10.1074/jbc.m110.163063 10.3389/fonc.2017.00118 10.1016/j.bbabio.2016.02.012 10.1186/1471-2148-9-295 10.1016/j.mito.2018.01.009 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.02.067 10.1016/j.bmcl.2008.11.071 10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.036 10.1186/1471-2105-6-31 10.1093/nar/gkr1178 10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00208.x 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170 10.1089/cmb.2012.0021 10.1093/nar/gkw294 10.1089/cmb.2014.0153 10.1186/gb-2007-8-6-r109 10.1093/bioinformatics/17.9.847 10.1016/j.jmb.2015.11.006 10.1038/s41598-018-28948-z 10.1093/nar/gkl315 10.1093/molbev/msm088 10.1093/molbev/msi237 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx431 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.051 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp163 10.1016/j.tree.2019.08.008 10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.050 10.1017/S0031182000060297 10.1093/molbev/msv021 10.1093/femsyr/fov023 10.1128/JB.176.18.5622-5630.1994 10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.021 10.1152/ajpcell.00225.2006 10.1128/AAC.01520-12 10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.023 10.1289/ehp.7721279 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90259-8 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08358.x 10.1042/bj20081386 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.10.511 10.1074/jbc.271.23.13875 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.12.021 10.1038/srep08220 10.1128/AAC.03570-14 10.4103/0973-7847.99942 10.2174/157340710793237290 10.1016/j.fgb.2015.01.006 10.1016/j.micres.2016.07.005 10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.045 10.1002/biot.201600497 10.1101/cshperspect.a011312 10.1042/bse0470053 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.12.008 10.1093/molbev/msn193 10.1093/ofid/ofy358 10.1007/978-3-030-13035-0_7 10.3390/genes9090461 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000111 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002718 10.1002/bies.201700050	33906412
34129020	Genome analysis of Candida subhashii reveals its hybrid nature and dual mitochondrial genome conformations.	Candida subhashii belongs to the CUG-Ser clade, a group of phylogenetically closely related yeast species that includes some human opportunistic pathogens, such as Candida albicans. Despite being present in the environment, C. subhashii was initially described as the causative agent of a case of peritonitis. Considering the relevance of whole-genome sequencing and analysis for our understanding of genome evolution and pathogenicity, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the genome of C. subhashii type strain. Our results show that C. subhashii presents a highly heterozygous genome and other signatures that point to a hybrid ancestry. The presence of functional pathways for assimilation of hydroxyaromatic compounds goes in line with the affiliation of this yeast with soil microbial communities involved in lignin decomposition. Furthermore, we observed that different clones of this strain may present circular or linear mitochondrial DNA. Re-sequencing and comparison of strains with differential mitochondrial genome topology revealed five candidate genes potentially associated with this conformational change: MSK1, SSZ1, ALG5, MRPL9 and OYE32.	2021	10.1093/dnares/dsab006	34129020
